## 🆘 Support & Contact

This application is maintained by an independent developer. To provide faster responses and to help other users facing similar issues, **I provide support via GitHub instead of email.**

If you have found a bug, have a suggestion, or are stuck on something, please follow the steps below to reach out.

### How to Create a Support Ticket (Issue)

You need a free GitHub account to ask questions or report bugs. If you have an account, follow these steps:

1.  **Go to the Issues Tab:**
    Click on the **"Issues"** tab located at the top of this page.

2.  **Search First:**
    Your question might have already been asked by someone else. Type your keywords into the "Filter" search bar. You might find your answer there immediately.

3.  **Open a New Issue:**
    If you couldn't find a solution, click the green **"New Issue"** button in the top right corner.

4.  **Write the Details:**
    * **Title:** Write a short summary of your problem. (e.g., "Icons not showing in Dark Mode")
    * **Leave a comment:** Describe your issue in detail.
        * If you are reporting a bug, explain the steps you took before the error occurred.
        * If possible, drag and drop screenshots of the error.
        * Mention your macOS version.

5.  **Submit:**
    Once you are done writing, click the **"Submit new issue"** button. I will get back to you here as soon as possible.
